DESCRIPTION:
    This is the "engine" of our application. It handles all direct interactions 
    with the SQLite database.

TEAM TASKS:
    1. Create a class (e.g., 'DatabaseManager') to handle connections.
    2. Implement 'CREATE' methods: add_student(), log_survey(), submit_assignment().
    3. Implement 'READ' methods: get_student_by_id(), get_all_surveys().
    4. Ensure all SQL queries use '?' placeholders to prevent SQL Injection.
    
    *Requirement: This file must demonstrate the ability to store and retrieve 
    data from a relational database[cite: 54, 73].*
